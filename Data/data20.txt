Researchers at The Michigan State University said that mice, who were fed a lower calorie diet had less ability to fight flu symptoms than their counterparts who were eating a normal diet. Studies also showed that their chances of death from the flu virus also increased. Mice eating a normal diet had the strength to fight off the virus and live a longer life.
