According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that a way should be found through which Hamas should be brought into the peace process of the Middle East. Blair also strongly criticized the Bush administration for talking only to Mahmoud Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should remain clear that the Western countries, after assessing the public and administrative power of Hamas, are now talking about including it in the conference, whereas before this they used to call Hamas a terrorist organization; a terrorist organization which is defending its country and trying to emancipate its country from the grip of others, whose houses and country have been occupied for sixty years by a tyrannical government like that of Israel.

According to the daily, Tony Blair said that it is important to find a way to include Hamas in the Middle East peace process. Blair strongly criticized the Bush Administration's policy of engaging Mahmud Abbas and completely ignoring Hamas. It is worth noting that Western countries have realized the public influence of Hamas and are now talking about including it in the dialogue process.

According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.
