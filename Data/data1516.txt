As far as your question is concerned, had the old man shifted to the widow's house after marriage rather than bringing her home, his heirs would have made token protests and then gone quiet and content (the heirs of the widow would then have had butterflies in their stomachs).

As far as your question is concerned, then Mister, why do you bring a widow home? Instead, you should be going to her house so that the relatives keep quiet after creating artificial havoc (well, there will be a stomach ache in the widow's family).
