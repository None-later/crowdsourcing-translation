on the basis that starting from artificial things till the functioning of this world , each and everything is pre-destined , the opinion being put forward is that human being 's fortunes can also be ascertained in advance as they happen according to something that is already decided

the global warming is used as a advertisement for economic and politics. so the developed countries should take effort to control the carbon level , and control the greenhouse effect .
the advertisement of scientific discovery on global warming has lead to the political and economical discussion. the poor continents , especially warming is high in african continent which clearly shows the dangerous consequences. the gas emission of these countries seems to be less compared to other developed countries. at the same time based on the giyoda method , the relaxation given to the developing countries has given chances to countries like america , australia to comment on this. also this has also become one of the reason for america to not to sign .
the wide publicity gained by the scientific findings on the subject of heating up of earth has resulted in an economic and political debate. poor nations have been threatened with dangers , particularly in the backdrop of the serious consequences on account of heating up of earth in africa. their gas emissions are less compared to that of developed nations. at the same time , the decision to exempt developing nations from the kyodo protocol have come in for sharp criticism from the us and australia. it has also been used by the us as a reason to justify its reluctance to sign the accord
there are significant doubts about some aspects of the ipcc 's emissions scenario exercise , in particular , the high emissions scenarios. the government should press the ipcc to change their approach. there are some positive aspects to global warming and these appear to have been played down in the ipcc reports ; the government should press the ipcc to reflect in a more balanced way the costs and benefits of climate change. the government should press the ipcc for better estimates of the monetary costs of global warming damage and for explicit monetary comparisons between the costs of measures to control warming and their benefits. since warming will continue , regardless of action now , due to the lengthy time lags .

big ocean to most heated reason all reflection slow reach reason weathers of solve this problem many centuries .
it may take several centuries for the temperature to become steady on account of several factors like big seas absorbing more heat
since the big ocean have more capacity to hold the heat and various slow reactions by other effects , it will take several century to regularize the temperature .
the thermal inertia of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing .

however , this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by camelcase reversal. for example , `` richardwagner '' should be rendered as `` richard wagner , '' whereas `` popularmusic '' should be rendered as `` popular music '' . there is no easy way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized. as a result , many wikis now have `` free linking '' using brackets , and some disable camelcase by default .
however , by reprocessing the links to improve the anchor readability will be limited by the loss of camelcase type capitalization information reversal.for example , '' rcihardwagner '' should be returned as `` richard wagner '' . sametime `` popularmusic '' should be returned as `` popular music '' .there is no easy way to determine which capital letter should be in capital.due to this , many wikis use brackets and get `` free links '' and some disable camelcase by default .
yet to develop reading , it is essential to write in capital letter.for eg. richard wagner is written as `` richard wagner '' at the same time the popular music is to be written popular music. there is not easy way to write in big size .
but evidence improvement can change the camelcase example richardwager at the mean time popular music ... and get free editions withn this .

it is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor for such links `` pretty '' by reinserting spaces , and possibly also reverting to lower case .
wiki has the possibility by reinserting the spaces to create `` perfect '' like visible anchor and also to come back for lowercase .
the support can be returned by joining the empty space like elegance by wikie. there is also a chance to come to lower case
vicky can joint the none space scenes and get proper joints and lower case

killing children by throwing them into boiling tar , setting alive a hindu teacher at pananthurai and many other such gory violent incidents that were carried out against tamils made him feel so much to sympathise with their cause
he had great love and sympathy upon the tamil people while hearing incidents that child 's were thrown into hot tar drum , a saint was killed by firing while he was in vital state .
he fel very sorry when he heard incidents on how army men kill small children by throwing them on bolind tarpaline , a hindu who was killed when hewas alive in paanamthurai,
circumstantial evidence suggested that his death was caused by massive head trauma , perhaps due to a shot at close range. there are also allegations that he was executed. the sri lankan army claimed to have found his body in a lagoon. the sri lankan army released pictures and videos of what they claimed was prabhakaran 's body lying on a stretcher , surrounded by soldiers. the corpse was dressed in prabhakaran 's uniform , had prabhakaran 's appearance , and had a large bullet wound in its forehead,

software of the gardens in the very efficient , weight of the try gain in the very important .
due to the problems caused by deliberate destruction , wikis resort to soft security measures only , as it is always easy to get rid of what is destroyed rather than trying to curb destruction

vickys are creating editing for users editing wysiwyg ( what you see is what you get )
note that the wysiwygness of an application is relative. originally , wysiwyg referred to any word processor that could accurately show line breaks on the display screen. later wysiwygs had to be able to show different font sizes , even if the screen display was limited to one typeface. now , a word processor must be able to display graphics and many different typefaces to be considered wysiwyg .
what you see is what you get this is a editing technique used by the wiki , the editing by means of the html and java script can be done. the `` bold '' and `` italics '' are done to indicate the important words in the wesite .
the wikies are creating the editing of `` wysiwyg '' ( what you see is what you get. ) which is usually done through javascript or html takes or an activex control which would translate the format commands such as `` bold '' and `` italics '' which is related to wiki talk .

the temperature at the centre of earth can go upto 7,000 kelvin and pressure upto 360 gpa
in center of the earth the temperature reached 7000 kelvin and density is 360 gpa .
many people suppose that the evidence from radioactive dating of minerals in rocks proves the earth must be of great age , at least a few billion years , but the concentration of radioactive isotopes in the rocks of the crust may be too high for an ancient earth .
the temperature at the earth 's center may reach 7,000 kelvins and pressure 360 gpa .

the temperature inside the earth is created by coming together of planets ( about 20 % ) and nuclear damages ( about 80 % )
in earth the inner temperature is formed because of eclipse , rest of the temperature 20 % and by the collision of atoms its created .
lord kelvin announced that not more than 40 million years could have passed since the earth solidified. because of kelvin 's enormous prestige and high standing as an authority in science , uniformitarian geologists were seriously embarrassed by this result. a long controversy followed
earth 's internal heat is due to residual heat because of planet 's combination ( 20 % ) and radiative decay ( 80 % ) .

the lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle , which constitute the hard and rigid outer layer of the earth. the lithosphere is underlain by the asthenosphere
finally high temperature loss due to the transfer of heat from the lithosphere , however mostly they will happen through sea more than the land because the thickness of the lithosphere under the sea is less .
finally maximum heat loss will be created by litho layer heat conduction. mostly they happens under sea mainly because litho is much thicker in sea region .
finally low and high loss of heat to lithe step of heat and strength raise .

in 1979 satellite limits of give to step mandalam to temperature straight and low of before that temperature in 1958 of step stones .
after getting the values from 1979 through satellites , the temperature in atmosphere are normal or slightly lesser. if we include the previous readings using balloon , then we note that the atmosphere temperature is gradually decreasing from 1958 onwards .
the satellite information taken till 1979 shows the temperature have remained normal or have reduced.before that we can see the layers getting cooled from the year 1958 .

sun and other planet gives high intensity level to other pressure density and it changes earth 's intensity level , more saturn planet too can be identified and it will change after some miilion years .
if only there was no sufficient resistance to withstand the pressure of the sun and other planets , the rotation of the earth would have been confusing. also , it would have resulted in varying changes for over million years

america is a mixed culture state , high seperated race people , tradition , and percentage country they are considered. < /ref > america '' race is like there is nothing ; now small park americans and traditional hawai island apart from people and there are lot of people shifted countries and placed to some where. american culture- there are many proofes as people has been shifted. < /ref ? in asia recent times many shifted , mainly lathin america there are many cultural people and this kind of place like two different culture is mixed .

america is multi-cultured country. there is no separate american religion. excep few american ancestors and people living in hawai island , all others are migrated into america only in last 5 century. the culture followed by america as american culture is the combination of other european culture and african culture. people migrated from asia mixed latin culture with the then american culture and modified as their convenience and the culture was looks like a salad plate .
the united states is a multicultural nation , home to a wide variety of ethnic groups , traditions , and values.aside from the now small native american and native hawaiian populations , nearly all americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries.the culture held in common by most americans—mainstream american culture—is a western culture largely derived from the traditions of european immigrants with influences from many other sources , such as traditions brought by slaves from africa.more recent immigration from asia and especially latin america has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics .

earth upper layer heat will cause increase in co2 recycle , which will decrease the carbon-di-oxide level which is essential for plants and trees ( c4 light 100 bpm )
as heat increases in the outer space of earth , it increases the revolution , hence in the next 900 million years , carbon-di-oxide which is essential for plants to prepare starch , decreases in the space
in geography due to increase of temperature co2 surrounds will place , next 900 million years many important specimens will die ( c4 light rays 10 bbm ) will decrease .
as the temperature of the outer crest increases , the inorganic co2 recycling increases and in the next 900 million years the carbon di oxide needed for the plants ( for photosynthesis 10 ppm ) will decrease in the atmosphere .

the problem in creating climatic sample was its dissimilarity with the actual situation. in 2007 as per the analysis made by david ductus and his team , they compared 22 leading climate samples with the real climate levels , and found out that these samples were not accurately calculated the changes happened in the hot environment zone. but scholars felt these results were in contradiction with the recent analysis report made in the same level. in 2008 , lawrence livermore national research center 's ben santer and his team of 17 members made a research on ducles experiment and found out that there are lot of mathematical and assumption errors found in that. hence they told there is not big statistical difference between the climate samples and the real one .
like in climate conditions , a minor problem in formations is the unmatching noticed between real situations and calculated ones. a research conducted by david douglas and his friends in 2007 found out that when the results of 22 leading climate models were compared with that of original results , the changes that were noticed in the model types were not exactly calculated. however , there are claims that recent studies entirely differ in opinion with the earlier one. a research conducted in 2008 by a 17-member team , led by ben santer , has claimed in a statement that the douglas ' research was full of calculation errors. the difference in calculation between the model ones and the original was not much , it said .
temperature is making of a small problem to what the true situation of samples to calculate of show the fixed of joint decision. larance of recently to teachers of ben santer of 17 member to 2008 to researchers to only of big sentences to research .
They conclude they haven't calculated the actual temperature in lower atmospheric regions and from their research they show the variation between theirs temperature values and other researches conducted before. Lawrence Live more National researcher Ben Santer headed a 17 members team in 2008 from their research showed mathematical errors is Douglas research, wrong assumptions and conclude there is no deviation in model and research as per his research.

weather forecast is depending upon the position of the sea. hot air circulation travells from pacific to bay of bengal .
ocean current has the important role in climatic changes , mainly heat halen revolves and spreads the heat energy from equator to two poles
the running of oceans also plays a role in climatic changes , particularly heat sink circle transfers the heat from equatorial sea to polar sea .
ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate , particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions .

due to the thinking related to the seven wonders of the world , the thoughts go back to herodotus ( 484-425b.c ) and callimachus ( 305-240b.c ) . they prepared an index that contains the pyramid of giza , hanging garden of babylon , jeus statue of olympia , ardemis temple at ephesus , mosolos monument at halikarnaasasil , colossus of rhodes and light house of alexantria .
british biographer , science writer , and novelist ronald w. clark is another who has published a list of man-made and natural wonders , in his book wonders of the world. rather than having only seven wonders of the world to match the number of days in a week , clark 's list includes 52 wonders , one for each week of the year
while talking about the seven wounders they are started to going back to the period of herodotus ( 484 - 425 after christ birth ) & callimachus ( 305- 240 after christ birth ) which includes kisa 's pyramid , pabiloniya 's hanging bridge , olympia 's zeus statue , arthimis temple which is in ephesus , memory things of masolos which is in halikarnasasil , colossus of rhodes , alexandria 's lighthouse
callimachus (km 305-Km240) and back of time pyramid and olimbiya geyus statues, Ephesus Arthamis temple, Halitosis, Colossus of Rhodes alexandriyar colossus of rohedus.

new7wonders said looking the recorded votes and their geographic location , proved their motivation on global communication and culture transmission had happen .
new 7 wonders announce submitted votes total and declines voters geographic and cultural things
results may lead at best to confusion , at worst to violence and even civil war , in the case of political rivals. many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference—they are neither accepted nor rejected. avoiding the choice that the most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favor .
if we have seen the registered number of votes , if the voter when we see their regional cultural , we have chieved the aim said by new 7 wonders

many environment teams fights against the global warming encourages individual steps to reduce the emission. they suggest the comparisons of co2 emissions in various energy and gives suggestion to reduce the co2 emission
atmosphere over their breakfast cereal. most have an opinion on whether the earth is truly warming over time. here , an examination of several sides co2 of the issue is given so you can make up your mind .
broecker 's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming , previously the phrasing used by scientists was `` inadvertent climate modification , '' because while it was recognized humans could change the climate , no one was sure which direction it was going. [ 128 ] the national academy of sciences first used global warming in a 1979 paper called the charney report , it said : `` if carbon dioxide continues to increase , [ we find ] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible. '' [ 129 ] the report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as global warming , while referring to other changes caused by increased co2 as climate change. this distinction is still often used in science reports , with global warming meaning surface temperatures , and climate change meaning other changes ( increased storms , etc.. )
most toor places used to decrease the co2 exposed links

in january 2005 european union released their european emission trade plan , which joins in hand with corporates and government to find the possible ways to reduce the emission and prepare a green house emission centers. australia announces their emission program in 2008. american president barrack obama also announces the plans to economically viable plans to reduce the emission
scientific debate is one of the backbones of research. in fact , one of the main ideas behind any scientific inquiry is a question , january 2005 arabia and the process fails. ignore data , in year 2008and the process fails .
carbon dioxide is colorless. at low concentrations , the gas is odorless. at higher concentrations it has a sharp , acidic odor. it will act as an asphyxiant and an irritant. when inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels , it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. these effects result from the gas dissolving in the mucous membranes and saliva , forming a weak solution of carbonic acid.a convenient property for this purpose is that solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly into the gas phase leaving no liquid. it can often be found in grocery stores and laboratories , and it is also used in the shipping industry. the largest non-cooling use for dry ice is blast cleaning .

for example , registered users in english wikipedia can rename the pages only after 4 days from their registration. other wikipedia like portuguese wikipedia are using editing request instead of time request. after the user shows his skills as a professional editor , more features will be given to him. basically 'closed ' wiki are safe and trustable , they made slow growth , at the same time , open wiki are faster in growth but easily vulnerable to deletion .
for example , registered users in english wikipedia needs at-least four days after registration to rename to pages. wikipedia like portuguese and others uses instead of time request they grant editing request , it validates the editor credibility by having count of valid edits before giving authorize to edits and gives additional tools to edit. basically closed wikipedia are safe and reliable but grows slowly , same time open wikipedia are growing rapidity , but prone to wanted deletions
example to english wikipedia 's registered to use and reduce the user account. four days of pages to again name of editing to closed wiki 's very safe to percentage of usually to deleted .
for example , english wikipedias allows minimum four days to rename their pages for the users. portugeese wikipedia and other wikis allows editing instead of keep waiting , after proving their ability and believeness the user will get access to more tools.basically closed wikis are safe and reliable.but the open wikis grows on the constant phase also purpouselly to delete the easy targets .

heat are air things to added north half most to spread these two half air mixed to take time air to join heated to no differences to reason .
there is no other particular factor to cite why the north records a higher temperature
although heat emitting metals secrets more metals in north half-pole , since it will be space for more time than the time taken for mixing , it will be bring any change in the global warming .
although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than southern hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres .

basically tamil litruture and bibles are described some kings history and birth of tamil nadu. but do n't have any evidence for chozhals birth and history
the literatures found in golden age of tamils helps us to have very little evidence about the cholas , it doesnt show with greater clarity and their history is not known clearly
though literatures by the academy of poets describe in detail , information about the various rulers and their kingdoms , from the beginning of christian era and though it helped to learn about the colakings to some extent , it is imposible to decifer their living period or their history beyond doubt .
generally the details of tamil kings and thier kings are available in the christ period tamil literatures but still there is no clear evidence about their place of living and history

the outer surface of the earth along the thicker membrane medium are collectively known as lithosphere. decconic plates were found in this layer only .
the crust and the cold , rigid , top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere , and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are comprised .
the outer layers of the earth and humidity and hard outer cored combined together to for lithosphere , tectonic layers are present in this lithosphere .
lithosphere is the combination of the over cover of the earth & cool , strong closer.dekdonick are placed in this lithoshere

outer surface of earth was separated by discontinuity of mohorovic from the medium. also the thickness of the layer is not even , under the sea it is approximately 6 km and under the land its 30-50 km .
the crust is separated from the mantle by the mohorovičić discontinuity and the thickness of the crust varies : averaging 6 km under the oceans and 30–50 km on the continents .
the outer layer and the inner core is separated by the mohorrovisic gap. then , the outer layer is not uniform in all the place. it is approximately 6km under the seas and 30-50 kms in land .
the closer is been segregated from the over cover because of the `` moheyrocivik '' , and the breath of the over coveris not even : under the earth on an average 6 km & on the base 30-50 km

there is a problem in that scientists found out so they wont accept it
increase the earth heat energy not a reason. and the scientist also think some of the heat not rejected that .
increasing earth heat is mantha reaction is not reason theory science also heat secruim reaction do n't introvert .
no one including the scientists saying that gravity not positioning depending activities is not a diluting matter can disagree the presence of heat capturing effect .

water heating ( 36-70 % ) carbondioxide ( 9-26 % ) ozone ( 3-7 % ) these are the reasons for heat capacity
strome is the main reason of ( it is effect of the tightly heat energy of 36 to 70 percentage ) , carbon-di-oxide ( co2 , is the reacted the heat tightly effect as 9-26 percentage ) . ch4 as the reasoned by the 4 to 9 percentage. ocean ( it is the heat of the heat energy of the 3 - 7 percentage is important of the properties .
evabraction ( in heating reaction is 30-70 percentage reacted ) , organic gas ( co2 , in heating reaction 9-26percent react ) , methain ( ch4heat reaction4-9percent react ) , ozone ( heat reaction3-7percent react ) , heat reaction important metals .
water evaporator ( in this heat capturing effect,36-70 percent diluted ) , diluting interference ( co2 , in this , heat capturing effect will be 9-26 percent diluted ) , methane ( ch4 , in this heat capturing effect will be 4-9 percent diluted ) , ozone ( in this , heat capturing effect will be 3-7 percent diluted ) are the important heat capturing substances .

this type of happenings is done in first.so that heat increases
rays of flat of cloud of important things. but it is as liquid or the stable of the stage will go down the differently measured as the effect .
rays reaction impront things is builak , but this liquid stage and fiber stage have so heat is calculated in water wiper .
sun rays directing equal state plays a vital role. but these water , in liquid state or solid state are present means its heat capturing effect is calculating against the water evaporator .

it increases the heat.in that co2 , methane , niride oxide chemicals are transfering the rays
as the first person of steps is tightly of the sky area. and it produce the co2 and ch4 and the based of the ocean and culro flora carban and naitras oxide. it is the rays touched the point .
work action is impurvied in heat reaction.in organ of co2 , methain , cloroblorocarbon , nitros oxied , gas their ways rotated .
from job revolution , people 's activities added interference region 's heat capturing effect , through this co2 , methane , under interference region , ozone , chlorofluorocarbon , nitrous oxide substances leads to compressing sun rays .

mathematics has been improved to a state so that we can tell no other department can improve without the help of mathematics .
no industry can grow without mathematics today that mathematics has entered almost all the fields .
without the application of mathematics no field in the industry can grow , that much the mathematics has flourished and has grown .
however any field , there is in little maths , so maths is in the all field , no field to have a maths

this make the climatic changes when north pole towards sun it is summer season and when it is moved away from it is winter season
hese differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot , which varies by latitude from the tropics. the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. weather systems in the mid-latitudes
this creates climatic changes depending upon some period.when north pole is about the sun , the summer time of north polar and winter is happened also when the same is away from the sun
due to long time changes in the environment ther is change in climatic conditions when north pole faces the sun it is summer and when is away from sun it is winter season

the usage of html script tag is because of its easy understandable character .
the reason behind the uasage to some html cryptic tag was , it was easier to edit .
at the bottom of the edit conflict page is a second editing box containing the text bob was going to submit. this will be bob 's version of the page or section he was editing .
the reason for using many cryptic takes of html is they are very understandable when we edit .

to illustrate the way and blocks we can use simple text editor for editing the content in wiki .
behind the usage of some html tags , some other methods of editing was also usable in wikipedia
this produces an edit conflict with oneself. in this case the upper text may be the old version instead of the one involving the first edit
wikis are helpful for some simple text editing than always using html styling and construction .

further because of this open type , if suppose any wrong or unregulated information provided we can change it again to valuable page because of the same property
because of its open book method , mostly illegal and unwanted informations was supplied to the wikipedia .but at the same time all the errors have been rectified to give an valuble wiki article
reproduction is the process by which an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself without a contribution of genetic material from another individual
more over because of it 's openness , there may be unfair usage and false information retrieval , but because of the same reason the faults are corrected immediately and again a good quality wiki page is got .

generally the wiki pages is built by a easy markup language , sometime it is called as `` wiki content '' . for example the usage of a single star ( `` * '' ) is used as the bulletins for the lists .
usually the pages in wikipedia has an regular format with an mark up language.it was also known as wiki article.for example , an article starts with an ( * ) asterix sign helps us to locate that in an bullettin box
one person attempts to edit the document , but upon trying to save the new version , another person has already modified the document in the intervening time period , thus causing a difference between the attempted edit and the already-made edit that must be resolved manually .
normally , the lay out and structure of wiki pages are specified by a simplified mark up language , this is sometimes called as wiki text. for example , when we start a sentence of a text with star symbol it means that can be used in a bulleted list .

the type of wiki content and words arrangement is always different , some html tags are also used here .
the font and tje style in wikipedia article differs widely from the pattern of the wikipedia some of tem uses html tags
this is a very common problem in wikipedia since there are millions of wikipedia users around the globe , and since many of them are signed in there can be many of them that are looking and editing a page simutaneously .
wiki text style and sentence formation varies widely in the wiki customization , some of this use the html takes .

geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle xenoliths brought up in kimberlite and other volcanic pipes. the histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods , including analyses of abundances of isotopes of osmium and rhenium. such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years , despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics
these plates are very hard in structure. also the move on and on each other and creates three boundaries. they are lessening boundaries , in this two plates move towards each other , move away boundaries , move away plates and changing boundaries , two plates laterally friction with each other .
these plates are closed tightly and creates three layers by moving one against another , they are formally reduced border , two plates moving with each other , plates moving against each other , and revising borders , and two plates touch another horizontally

oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years , but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. this is because the chemically-differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere , but due to thermal contraction , the mantle lithosphere is more dense than the asthenosphere
tectonic plates move on the astheno layer. this plate is not very hard and they are movable with the tectonic plates .
tectonic plate moves above ashton plate , these plates are semisolid but strong upper region enables them to move around plates

jain monk ilango , in his epic had not described any importance of his religious thoughts or the greatness of his chera kingdom or underestimated any other kingdom , this added an ornamental value and justice to his epic .
samana religion based poet elango , did n't write any of his religion 's thoughts as well as chera country 's proud by depressing other countries add upon its value
in his lyrics , as he belongs to jain religion but never mention about his re religion , also about his country cheranadu or criticized other country or religion
elango was a buddhist yet he did not include the teachings of his religion or the specialities of his chera kingdom anywhere in this epic and he had not critisized the other kingdoms , this showed the greatness of thie epic .
