They call the last mentioned climatic change as the green house effect: This specifies the increase in the earth's temperature when the evaporation from the land is captured by small ions in the atmosphere.

Finally some of the changes of temperature in atmosphere called Green house effect.They transfer this energy to other components of the atmosphere, and it is re-radiated in all directions, including back down towards the surface. This transfers energy to the surface and lower atmosphere, so the temperature there is higher than it would be if direct heating by solar radiation.
