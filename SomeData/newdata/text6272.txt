Earth upper layer heat will cause increase in Co2 recycle, which will decrease the Carbon-DI-oxide level which is essential for plants and trees (C4 light 100 BPM)

As the temperature of the outer crest increases, the inorganic CO2 recycling increases and in the next 900 million years the carbon di oxide needed for the plants (for photosynthesis 10 ppm) will decrease in the atmosphere.
