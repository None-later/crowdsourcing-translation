After getting the values from 1979 through satellites, the temperature in atmosphere are normal or slightly lesser. If we include the previous readings using balloon, then we note that the atmosphere temperature is gradually decreasing from 1958 onwards.

the satellite information taken till 1979 shows the temperature have remained normal or have reduced.before that we can see the layers getting cooled from the year 1958.
