Finally high temperature loss due to the transfer of heat from the lithosphere, however mostly they will happen through sea more than the land because the thickness of the lithosphere under the sea is less.

Finally maximum heat loss will be created by Litho layer heat conduction. Mostly they happens under sea mainly because litho is much thicker in sea region.
