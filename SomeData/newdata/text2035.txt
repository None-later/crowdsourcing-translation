Possible economic effect, extreme situation can reduce the global domestic production by 1%, in extreme condition per global consumption per person will reduce to 20%. This article assumptions and suggestions are reviewed by many economists. But still they agreed to impossible ways of calculating economic danger in numerical figures, one can assume the effects of economic crisis.

The main tools for projecting future climate changes are mathematical models based on physical principles including fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and radiative transfer. Although they attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. All modern climate models are in fact combinations of models for different parts of the Earth
