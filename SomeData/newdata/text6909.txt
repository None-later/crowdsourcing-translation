For example, registered users in English Wikipedia can rename the pages only after 4 days from their registration. Other Wikipedia like Portuguese Wikipedia are using editing request instead of time request. After the user shows his skills as a professional editor, more features will be given to him. Basically 'closed' wiki are safe and trustable, they made slow growth, at the same time, open wiki are faster in growth but easily vulnerable to deletion.
