The comparison of stars with the Earth rotation has been named as Steller day by International Earth rotation Service. This average Sun time or Earth rotation span has been known as Earth centrifugal force or average vernal equinox when this is wrongly compared as one star day.This is the average sun time.

at the time is calculated by UT1.
