Earth's only natural satellite is moon, which started to revolve round the earth some 4.53 billion years ago, this creates waves in the sea, stabilize the axis angle and slowly reduces its speed of rotation.

the natural one we know is moon,before 4.56 billion years it start to rotate,due to this waves were crating in oceans,and the axis bend of earth also stopped
