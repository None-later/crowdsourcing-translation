But for this stability working against the positive pressure exerted by the sun and other planets on the bulge of the equator on earth, the axis of the earth would have become unstable and unbalanced. Moreover, some learned men believe that like it happens on the Mars, it would have effected metamorphic changes on earth for more than a million years.

Sun and other planet gives high intensity level to other pressure density and it changes earth's intensity level, more saturn planet too can be identified and it will change after some miilion years.

IF ONLY THERE WAS NO SUFFICIENT RESISTANCE TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURE OF THE SUN AND OTHER PLANETS, THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSING. ALSO, IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN VARYING CHANGES FOR OVER MILLION YEARS
