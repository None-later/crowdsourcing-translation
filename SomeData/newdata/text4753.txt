Since the wave-legnth of the blue and violet colours, in the  Sun's spectrum are long, the whiteness is reduced and looks like yellow color for human eyes.

Since the wave lengths of the Violet and the blue colour rays from the Sun rays are larger, the scattering of light happens and the wavelengths gets decreased and appears to be in Yellow colour.
