Many  environment  teams fights against the global warming  encourages individual steps to reduce the emission. They suggest the comparisons of co2 emissions in various energy and gives suggestion to reduce the co2 emission

Broecker's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming, previously the phrasing used by scientists was "inadvertent climate modification," because while it was recognized humans could change the climate, no one was sure which direction it was going.[128] The National Academy of Sciences first used global warming in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report, it said: "if carbon dioxide continues to increase, [we find] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible."[129] The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as global warming, while referring to other changes caused by increased CO2 as climate change. This distinction is still often used in science reports, with global warming meaning surface temperatures, and climate change meaning other changes (increased storms, etc..)
