Addition research are based on the calculated year 2100, even heat congestion is completely stooped or Oceanside heat absorption ends, carbon-DI-oxide life, which shows global warming will even continue after 2100.

it was not until the invention of the electric telegraph in 2100 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before this time, it was not widely practicable to transport information about the current state of the weather any faster than a steam train (and the train also was a very new technology at that time). The telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously
