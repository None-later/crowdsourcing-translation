Six of the ten Canadian provinces use county as a regional subdivision. These include all four original provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, as well as the fifth province, Prince Edward Island, and Alberta. Only portions of Ontario are counties; other divisions include districts, district municipalities, metropolitan municipalities, and regional municipalities. The same is the situation with Alberta, where out of its 64 subdivision entities, 45 are identified as a county (by the end of 2009), and other divisions include municipal districts, specialized municipalities, special areas, regional municipalities and improvement districts. Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan use census divisions instead of counties, and British Columbia uses Regional Districts. County can be abbreviated as either co. or cty.
