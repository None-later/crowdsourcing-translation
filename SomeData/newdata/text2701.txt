Manchula (not her real name) is the mother of a one year-old boy, Balachandran, who was transferred from the Jaffna Teaching Hospital to the Lady Ridgeway Childrens' Hospital in Colombo for medical tests. They were flown on a special plane charter service provided by the ICRC. None of the patients from Jaffna – all Tamils – felt comfortable to give their real names or have their photo taken.
