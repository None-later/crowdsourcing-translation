Geoscientists can directly study the nature of the subcontinental mantle by examining mantle xenoliths brought up in kimberlite and other volcanic pipes. The histories of these xenoliths have been investigated by many methods, including analyses of abundances of isotopes of osmium and rhenium. Such studies have confirmed that mantle lithospheres below some cratons have persisted for periods in excess of 3 billion years, despite the mantle flow that accompanies plate tectonics

These plates are very hard in structure.  Also the move on and on each other and creates three boundaries. They are lessening boundaries, in this two plates move towards each other, move away boundaries, move away plates and changing boundaries, two plates laterally friction with each other.

These plates are closed tightly and creates three layers by moving one against another, They are formally  reduced border, two plates moving with each other, plates moving against each other, and revising borders, and two plates touch another horizontally
