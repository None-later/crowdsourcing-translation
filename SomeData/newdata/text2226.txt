The global warming is used as a advertisement for economic and politics. so the developed countries should take effort to control the carbon level, and control the greenhouse effect.

The advertisement of Scientific discovery on Global warming has lead to the political and economical discussion. The poor continents, especially warming is high in African continent which clearly shows the dangerous consequences. The gas emission of these countries seems to be less compared to other developed countries. At the same time based on the Giyoda method, the relaxation given to the developing countries has given chances to  countries like America, Australia to comment on this. Also this has also become one of the reason for America to not to sign.

THE WIDE PUBLICITY GAINED BY THE SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS ON THE SUBJECT OF HEATING UP OF EARTH HAS RESULTED IN AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEBATE. POOR NATIONS HAVE BEEN THREATENED WITH DANGERS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BACKDROP OF THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES ON ACCOUNT OF HEATING UP OF EARTH IN AFRICA. THEIR GAS EMISSIONS ARE LESS COMPARED TO THAT OF DEVELOPED NATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DECISION TO EXEMPT DEVELOPING NATIONS FROM THE KYODO PROTOCOL HAVE COME IN FOR SHARP CRITICISM FROM THE US AND AUSTRALIA. IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED BY THE US AS A REASON TO JUSTIFY ITS RELUCTANCE TO SIGN THE ACCORD

There are significant doubts about some aspects of the IPCC's emissions scenario exercise, in particular, the high emissions scenarios. The Government should press the IPCC to change their approach. There are some positive aspects to global warming and these appear to have been played down in the IPCC reports; the Government should press the IPCC to reflect in a more balanced way the costs and benefits of climate change. The Government should press the IPCC for better estimates of the monetary costs of global warming damage and for explicit monetary comparisons between the costs of measures to control warming and their benefits. Since warming will continue, regardless of action now, due to the lengthy time lags.
