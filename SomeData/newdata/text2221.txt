Climate Change issue has lead to the discussion on control of Industrial Green house gas emission and the expenses to meet these changes.To control the emission of Carbon the alternate for existing fuel and its expenses is under discussion in various countries. The opponent companies and the committees like Exonmobile are highlighting the expenses to meet the stringent control at the same time they are highlighting the additional climate changes. Likewise various environmental organisation, popular personalities have started canvasing for the negative consequences of the climate changes and the stringent controlling measures.

THE ISSUE OF CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS HAS INVITED DEBATE ON THE POSSIBLE CONTROL ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE ACTUAL EXPENSES INVOLVED IN SUCH A PROCEDURE. TALKS ARE ALSO GOING ON IN MANY NATIONS REGARDING FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND THE EXPENDITURE INVOLVED IN DOING SO, IN CASE OF BRINGING DOWN CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION. AT THE SAME TIME WHEN MANY ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE EXXON MOBIL STRESSED THE NEED FOR CONTROLLING THE ECONOMY BY LIMITING THE EXPENSES, IT ALSO CALLED FOR A SITUATION WITH ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. SIMILARLY, SEVERAL POPULAR ORGANISATIONS HAVE STARTED A CAMPAIGN TO THROW LIGHT ON THE DANGERS POSED BY THE CHANGES IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND TO ENCOURAGE STRINGENT MEASURES TO CONTROL THEM.
