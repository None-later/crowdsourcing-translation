It has been either the DMK or the ADMK (or a coalition led by either of them) that has been winning a majority of seats from 1967 till elections were held to the state assembly last in 2001. Although several parties have been forming coalitions during assembly polls in Tamil nadu, the state has only witnessed a single-party rule so far.
