Strome is the main reason of (it is effect of the tightly heat energy of 36 to 70 percentage), carbon-di-oxide (Co2, is the reacted the heat tightly effect as 9-26 percentage). CH4 as the reasoned by the  4 to 9 percentage. ocean (it is the heat of the heat energy of the 3 - 7 percentage is important of the properties.
