the sun and moon angle size may be same because the diameter of sun is like moon diameter with multiplication of 400. like above also the distance of sun from here is equal to multiplication with 400 of distance of moon from here to moon

Both these planets diameter looks like similar, because sun diameter is 400 times more than moon, 400 times distant than moon.
