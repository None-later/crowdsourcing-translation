The problem in creating climatic sample was its dissimilarity with the actual situation. In 2007 as per the analysis made by David Ductus and his team, they compared 22 leading climate samples with the real climate levels, and found out that these samples were not accurately calculated the changes happened in the hot environment zone. But scholars felt these results were in contradiction with the recent analysis report made in the same level. In 2008, Lawrence Livermore national research center's Ben Santer and his team of 17 members made a research on Ducles experiment and found out that there are lot of mathematical and assumption errors found in that. Hence they told there is not big statistical difference between the climate samples and the real one.

like in climate conditions, a minor problem in formations is the unmatching noticed between real situations and calculated ones. A research conducted by David Douglas and his friends in 2007 found out that when the results of 22 leading climate models were compared with that of original results, the changes that were noticed in the model types were not exactly calculated. However, there are claims that recent studies entirely differ in opinion with the earlier one. A research conducted in 2008 by a 17-member team,led by Ben Santer, has claimed in a statement that the Douglas' research was full of calculation errors. The difference in calculation between the model ones and the original was not much, it said.

temperature  is making of a small problem to what the true situation of samples to calculate of show the fixed of joint decision. Larance of recently to teachers of Ben Santer of 17 member to 2008 to researchers to only of big sentences to research.

Small problems in climatic model developments is difference between the actual situation and model resemblance. In 2007 David Ductus and his team research done comparison with 22 top earth climate  model with original climatic changes event.
They conclude they haven't calculated the actual temperature in lower atmospheric regions and from their research they show the variation between theirs temperature values and other researches conducted before. Lawrence Live more National researcher Ben Santer headed a 17 members team in 2008 from their research showed mathematical errors is Douglas research, wrong assumptions and conclude there is no deviation in model and research as per his research.
