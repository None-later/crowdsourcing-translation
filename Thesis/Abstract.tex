\section{ABSTRACT}
Crowdsourcing makes it possible to create translations at much lower cost than hiring professional translators. However, it is still expensive to obtain millions of translations needed to train high performance statistical machine translation systems. We proposed two mechanisms to reduce the cost of crowdsourcing while maintaining high translation quality.
First, we develop a translation reducing method. We train a linear model to evaluate the translation quality on a sentence-by-sentence basis, and fit a threshold between acceptable and unacceptable translations. Unlike past work, which always paid for a fixed number of translations of each source sentence and then chose the best from them, we can stop earlier and pay less when we receive a translation that is good enough. Second, we introduce a translator reducing method by quickly identifying bad translators after they have translated only a few sentences. This also allows us to rank translators, so that we re-hire only good translators to reduce cost.
