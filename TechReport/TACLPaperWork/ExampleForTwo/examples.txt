Critics say that the American President has started to make efforts to save America's declining credibility on a global level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed because as long as America is prepared to support Israel's bloodthirsty government, it can't be expected to do any good. If America wants to save its credibility in the world, then it should desist from supporting Israel and being an accomplice in its crimes.
The observers say that the American President has started making efforts to save the falling reputation of America on the international level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed in it, because as long as America is supporting the predator government of Israel, nothing good can be expected from her. If America wants to save its reputation, then it has to withdraw from supporting Israel and should not participate in her crimes.
According to analysts, the American president has started attempts to save America's falling image on the global level but it is difficult for him to be successful in this task. As long as America continues to support the murderous regime in Israel, one cannot expect anything good of it. If the America wants to save its image, it should keep itself away from supporting Israel and should not become part of its crimes.
Analysts are of the view that the efforts of the US President are aimed at saving America's deteriorating image in the world, but it will be extremely difficult for him to succeed in this task, because as long as the US continues to support the oppressive Israeli regime, nothing good can come of it. If the United States wants to save its reputation in the international community, it will have to end its support of Israel and refuse to be a partner in its crimes.

The answer to this is that they have the protection of some "secret benefactor," which enables them to neither run out of weapons nor get caught.
The only answer to this question is that they are being protected by some unknown power because neither their ammunition gets exhausted nor they get caught
The answer can only be that they have the blessing of some 'secret saint' so neither they run out of ammunition nor they get caught
The answer is that they are supported by some 'hidden power', as neither are their weapons turned over, nor are they caught.

Unless a person realizes what is right and what is wrong, they continue to err.
Unless a man starts feeling the difference between right and wrong, he will continue to make mistakes.
As long as a man does not develop a sense of right and wrong, he continues to err.
A person keeps committing mistakes as long as he fails to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong.
مثال کے طور پر ایک چور جب چوری کرنے کے لیے جاتا ہے اگر اس کو اُس وقت یہ خیال آجائے کہ ’چوری کرنا اچھی بات نہیں اور چوری ایک لعنت ہے، اس میں سزا بھی ہے اور وہ خدا سے ڈرتا ہو‘تو وہ انسان چوری نہیں کرے گا

For instance, if someone goes to steal and realizes at that moment that "theft is not a good thing and it's a curse, it entails punishment and they are also afraid of God," they would not steal.
For example, when a thief attempts a theft, and at that time he gets a feeling that 'theft is not a good thing and it is a curse and involves punishment and he fears God' then he will not commit theft
For instance, when a thief sets out to commit a theft but realizes in time that 'theft is not good; it is a curse; he will be punished and he also fears God', then he won't commit theft.
For example, if a thief realizes that theft is a bad habit and a curse, and that it brings punishment and the wrath of God, then this realization will serve as an effective deterrent for him, and he will not proceed with his plan of theft.
اسی طرح سے جب تک اسرائیل کو یہ احساس نہ ہو جائے کہ میں غلط کرتا ہوں اور معصوموں کا خون بہا رہا ہوں اور اس کو اس کی سزا ملے گی تب تک وہ غزہ میں معصوموں کے خون کے ساتھ ہولی کھیلتا رہے گا۔

in a similar way unless Israel develops a feeling that it is doing wrong and killing innocent people and will be punished for this until that time Israel will continue to play with the blood of innocent people in Gaza.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it has been committing something wrong by spilling the blood of the innocent people and rendering itself to punishment, it will continue to play havoc with the lives of the innocent people in Gaza.

As if subsequent to the coming of Muslims, Allah has ordered all those who follow the Judeo-Christian scriptures to be wiped off the face of the earth.
As if leaving the Muslims alone, all 'those believing in Allah's book' and living on this earth should be exterminated is the command of God
So, it is God's commandment to wipe out all those on whom 'divine books' were revealed from the face of the earth except Muslims.
It's as if Allah has ordered the cleansing of all Ahle-Kitab (believers in divine books) other than Muslims from the face of the earth.

In the use of these tricks now, our own Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists etc., are not behind anyone else. In their coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or on writing about these, they bring in their own pet peeves and grudges.
In this skill, our Pakistani electronic and print media, particularly some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are now not behind in this race, who, while giving coverage to increasing extremism and terrorism here or writing about it intentionally, give a distorted view of the things based on their own mindset.

As far as the elections are concerned, those in power will take such measures as to please the people, and without a doubt especially a state like Israel. As far as Barack Obama is concerned, history is a witness that no American president to date has gone against the ruling policy, and this will not even happen. An imperialist, whether black or white, is an imperialist.
As far as election is concerned for earning public popularity, the people in power may carry on with this type of activity, no doubt in that, particularly the state of Israel; and as far as Barack Obama is concerned, history stands witness to the fact that until today, no American leader went against the policy and will not do so in the future; imperialism being black or white makes no difference at all.
As far as the elections are concerned, the rulers may undoubtedly engage in this kind of activities to win public support, particularly in case of a state like Israel. And as far as Barack Obama's factor is concerned, history stands testimonial to the fact that neither any American ruler has ever gone against the policy nor he will. Imperialism, whether black or white, is after all imperialism.
As far as the elections are concerned, there is no doubt that the ruling class, particularly in Israel, carries out such operations in order to win people's support.

India says that the person they arrested for the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani national and he had also sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. However, it is significant to note that initially, when Indian authorities arrested this extremist, they claimed that he was an accomplished engineer, but later they said that his education was only at the fourth grade level, something to be determined.
India says that the person caught in the Mumbai attacks is from Pakistan, and he has also written and sent a letter to Pakistan in Urdu, but on the other hand, when India got hold of this extremist, they said that he is a highly-qualified engineer, but later on, they said that he is educated only up to four class. This is strange.

India's efforts to gain undue diplomatic and military advantage as a compensation for the Mumbai attacks have made it appear to be a clever, rather than effective, party. This is why, after the initial strong international reaction, now the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan.
Indian efforts in seeking compensation for the Mumbai attacks in terms of extraordinary diplomatic and military benefits indicate that it is crying more than it was originally affected that is why contrary to initial strong international reaction, the world has now released pressure on Pakistan.
India's attempts to gain military and diplomatic benefits in compensation for the Mumbai attacks has been portraying it more as a cunning party than the affected one. That is why the world community has lessened its pressure on Pakistan after harsh initial reaction.
In reaction to the Mumbai attacks, India has been trying to reap the unusual diplomatic and military benefits. While projecting itself as a victim, it has acted wisely in exploiting these attacks. That's why the global pressure on Pakistan has now decreased despite strong global reaction initially.

When these people move from one place to another, it takes some time, during which they can be captured. But the army leaves the place, even if it's there, let alone capturing them during their movement.
It is because when these people move, it surely takes time. There is enough time to arrest them, but they run away - even if they are present at the occasion, let alone reaching the spot.
This is proven by the fact that when these people move, the movement would at least take so much time that that they could be arrested. But let alone reaching the spot, these people even if they are in vicinity, flee the place.
Because it is understandable that it may take time for the army to move there and nab them. But, how can they manage to flee even if the army is present there.

The great dictator of his time, Zia-ul-Haq, due to his authoritarianism, instead of highlighting the compassionate and merciful attributes of God, created an atmosphere of fear and terror for the faith through the discussions of the variety of forms of God's wrath and punishments. The incidence of the hanging corpse and books titled "What Will Happen After Death" produce fear and terror.
The religious scholars since the truly dictatorial regime of dictator of the world Zia-ul-Haq, contrary to projecting God's attributes of kindness and affection, have been creating an atmosphere of fear and terror by telling countless stories of punishments and admonitions in the name of religion, in which the incident of hanging dead bodies and additionally their literature and books like 'What will happen after death' are also creating fear and terror.
Since the era of true dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq, the Mullahism has been creating such an atmosphere of fear and terror in the name of religion by its descriptions of the various kinds of exemplary punishments and torture rather than highlighting the mercy and love of God. Besides, the incident of hanging of the corpse, their literature and books like 'What will Happen after the Death' strike terror in the hearts.
Since the time of the dictator Ziaul Haq, who was the real dictator, Mullahism has been reminding us about different types of punishments and telling wise stories in the name of religion, creating an atmosphere of terror. Instead they should have highlighted qualities of God such as mercy. Incidents like hanging dead bodies (on trees) and their literature, like the book titled "What will happen after death?," also create a sense of terror and fear.

A question was put forth by BBC whether appropriate or not, but the superficiality of it was disheartening. For instance, no one asked the question as to what the 30,000 armed troops in Swat have gone there to accomplish.
Even if the question asked by the BBC is rational or irrational, we feel sorry to observe the superficial knowledge of writers, for example no one asked the question that, what was the objective before thirty thousand soldiers went to Sawat?
Whether or not the question asked by BBC was appropriate, the credulity of the writers hurts. For instance, no one asked why had this thirty thousand strong army gone to Swat?
It does not matter whether the question asked by the BBC is reasonable or not. However, the low standard of the comments is regrettable. For example, nobody asked what 30,000 army men were doing in Swat...

Events tell us that the former Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's period, and efforts to eliminate the armed groups that were born as a result of the resistance to it with America-Saudi funding, to take Pakistan to the state it was in before 1980, were not successful.
The circumstances indicate that the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's regime and resistance thereof by the armed groups formed by funding from America and Saudi Arabia cannot be eliminated now, and any efforts to take Pakistan back to the pre-nineteen hundred &amp; eighty position by trying to do this have not been successful.
The conditions reveal that the attempts to take Pakistan back to pre-nineteen hundred &amp; eighty position by dismantling the armed groups that were formed during general Zia-ul-Haq's era as a result of former Soviet Union's intervention into Afghanistan and the consequent Saudi and American funded resistance, have not succeeded.
The situation dictates that Pakistan could not attain a pre-80s General Zia-ul-haq regime type of situation by disarming those who are a product of a conflict created by the former Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and America-Saudi funded armed groups.

A man's second marriage is obscene, divorce is a blot that cannot be hidden, a divorced woman is untouchable, marriage by choice ruins reputations, and a man's marriage with a older woman is seen as a result of the woman's trickery. All these attitudes reflect the same mindset.
Terming a man's second marriage as immoral, divorce a sign of shame, a divorced woman as an untouchable, love marriage as a sign of disrespect and a man marrying a woman of higher age as the cleverness of woman, is a result of this way of thinking.
To consider the second marriage of a man as livid, divorce as a stigma, a divorced woman as an untouchable, love marriage as a shameful act, and the marriage of a younger man with an older woman as a sign of her wickedness are the results of this particular mindset.
Because of this pattern of thinking, we consider a second marriage of a male as bad, divorce as a blot, divorcee women an untouchable, marriage of one's choice as a stain on one's honor, and marriage of a man with an aged woman is considered a deceitful tactics of the woman.
